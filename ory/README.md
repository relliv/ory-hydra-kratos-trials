# Ory Hydra Example Docker Stack

[Ory Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/) focuses on [authentication and authorization](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/identity-fundamentals/authentication-and-authorization) processes. Hydra is a headless Oauth 2.0 solution for distributed systems.

In this project contains **Ory Hydra**, **Postgres** (as a database) and **Jaegertracing** (for tracing).

Also Hydra is providing admin endpoints, see postman examples.

Hydra is not providing user management system, use Ory Kratos for that.
